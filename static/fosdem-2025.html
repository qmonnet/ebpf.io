<h1 id="fosdem-2025-ebpf-devroom-call-for-participation">FOSDEM 2025 eBPF Devroom Call for Participation</h1>
<p>We are delighted to announce the <strong>Call for Participation</strong> (CFP) for the very first <strong>eBPF Devroom at FOSDEM</strong>!</p>
<h2 id="mark-the-dates">Mark the Dates</h2>
<ul>
<li>November 27th, 2024: Submission deadline</li>
<li>December 15th, 2025: Announcement of accepted talks and schedule</li>
<li>1st February 2025 (Saturday afternoon): eBPF Devroom at FOSDEM</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="ebpf-at-fosdem">eBPF at FOSDEM</h2>
<p>Originally introduced to make the Linux kernel more programmable, eBPF allows users to load safe and efficient programs into the kernel, in order to implement custom logic running on specific events. The main use cases include kernel or user-space tracing and monitoring, network packet processing, security policies enforcement, or process scheduling. Today, eBPF also extends to Windows, user-space runtimes, or hardware offloads. The depth of the ecosystem has expanded far beyond its original goals and has seen increasing adoption from both enthusiasts and professionals within the open-source community, while the list of use cases and eBPF-based projects continues to grow.</p>
<p>FOSDEM is a free, community-organized event focusing on open source, and aiming at gathering open source software developers and communities to meet, learn, and share. It takes place annually in Brussels, Belgium. After hosting a number of eBPF-related talks in various devrooms over the years, FOSDEM 2025 welcomes a devroom dedicated to eBPF for the first time! This devroom aims at gathering talks about various aspects of eBPF, ideally on multiple platforms.</p>
<h2 id="topics-of-interest">Topics of Interest</h2>
<p>FOSDEM is an event centered on free and open-source software development, and brings the opportunity to reach a large audience of knowledgeable, highly technical open-source software activists. If you have something to present about eBPF, we would love for you to consider submitting a proposal to the Devroom.</p>
<p>The projects or technologies discussed in the talks <strong>MUST</strong> be open-source.</p>
<p>Topics of interest for the Devroom include (but are not limited to):</p>
<ul>
<li>eBPF development: recent or proposed features (on Linux, on other platforms, or even cross-platform), such as:
<ul>
<li>eBPF program signing and supply chain security</li>
<li>Profiling eBPF with eBPF</li>
<li>eBPF-based process schedulers</li>
<li>eBPF in storage devices</li>
<li>eBPF verifier improvements or alternative implementations</li>
<li>Memory management for eBPF</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Deep-dives on existing eBPF features</li>
<li>Working with eBPF: best practices, common mistakes, debugging, etc.</li>
<li>eBPF toolchain, for compiling, managing, debugging, packaging, and deploying eBPF programs and related objects</li>
<li>eBPF libraries, in C/C++, Go, Rust, or other languages</li>
<li>eBPF-based projects, related use cases</li>
<li>eBPF in the real world, production use cases and their impact</li>
<li>eBPF community efforts (documentation, standardization, cross-platform initiatives)</li>
</ul>
<p>The list is not exhaustive, don’t hesitate to submit your proposal!</p>
<h2 id="format">Format</h2>
<p>FOSDEM 2025 will be an in-person event in Brussels, Belgium. We do not accept remote presentations.</p>
<p>We’re looking for… TODO</p>
<h2 id="how-to-submit">How to Submit</h2>
<p>Please submit your proposals on Pretalx, FOSDEM’s submissions tool.</p>
<p>Make sure to select <strong>“eBPF” as the <em>track</em></strong>.</p>
